### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 is one of my favorite labs because we work on filtering vectors. The code filters the numbers in a vector based on different factors. For this lab we filter vectors based on multiples of three and five and the code prints the amount of numbers of vectors that are multiples of three and five.

* Lab 8

    Lab 7 is another favorite of mine that utilizes loops to print out patterns. We used a loop to print out a specific number of dashes to create a triangle.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 is my last favorite lab where we code a game using multiple if statements. The game is a word guessing game where a user inputs a word to guess a secret word. An if statement is used to check if the word that is inputted matches and if it does the user wins the game.
